# PreAngel

PreAngel is a fund focus on the initial financing for Artificial Intelligence(AI) startups in Beijing. It normally invests 10K to 20K USD in each deal for 2% - 10% of its equity.

PreAngel Fund was founded in 2011 and over time has developed a 1 billion RMB (150 million USD) portfolio, comprising 300 tech startups. Guided by the investment philosophies of “tackling social challenges with market wisdom” and “thinking outside the box and rising above adversities”, PreAngel Fund has not only prospered but also evolved into an umbrella fund that encompasses 荷多资本, 喔赢资本, 十维资本, and 伽利略资本 etc.
