PreAngel is a fund focus on the initial financing for Artificial Intelligence(AI) startups in Beijing. It normally invests 10K to 20K USD in each deal for 2% - 10% of its equity.

PreAngel Fund was founded in 2011 and over time has developed a 1 billion RMB (150 million USD) portfolio, comprising 300 tech startups. Guided by the investment philosophies of “tackling social challenges with market wisdom” and “thinking outside the box and rising above adversities”, PreAngel Fund has not only prospered but also evolved into an umbrella fund that encompasses 荷多资本, 喔赢资本, 十维资本, and 伽利略资本 etc.


PA基金股东多来自著名天使投资人（薛蛮子，蔡文胜，雷军，刘晓松、陈荣，刘炳海，刘成敏，李晓光，钟模林等）、国内互联网巨头公司高管（百度、阿里、腾讯、网易、新浪、搜狐等）。投资风格以和股东及天使基金联合投资为主（深港产学研、中路资本、海银资本、青松资本、长城会等）。
